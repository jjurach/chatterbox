### New Files

| `docs/tool-development.md` | Developer guide: step-by-step instructions for adding a new tool, design guidelines (never raise from dispatcher, return JSON, write clear TOOL_DEFINITION descriptions), optional caching, and a Done checklist |
| `docs/conversation-flows.md` | Annotated message traces for 8 scenarios: direct response, single tool call, concurrent multi-tool, multi-turn conversation, tool error, LLM rate-limit error, max-iterations exceeded, and cache hit |

### Modified Files

|------|--------|
