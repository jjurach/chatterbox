Execute these diagnostic steps without a project plan:

- run `scripts/run-server.sh status` to ensure the server is already running
  - run `scripts/run-server.sh restart` to (re)start the server

- execute `scripts/chat-demo.sh`, and then consult the last 20 lines of the log for any problems.

- fix any problems.

- keep re-runing `scripts/chat-demo.sh` until there are no problems.
